The assignment was to create a program which took in symptoms and gave back the probability of having tonsilitis using the naive bayes algorithm. I ran into a lot of dead ends and challenges, some of which giving me more of a challenge than I had hoped for but none the less I tried to get past each hurdle I found. It consists of 5 classes, one controler for the GUI, one for the GUI layout, one for the algorithm, a patient class, and a class for the file processing. It isn't fully functional and at the moment only displays the probability of whether or not the user has tonsillitis. I am not the proudest of this work but it works to a certain extent.
